## socket

### Server

#### Current

```python
game = EscapeRoomGame()
game.create_game(cheat=("--cheat" in args))
game.start()
while game.status == "playing":
    command = input(">> ")
     # prints out >> to the screen, reads input from the keyboard, and returns it
     # then pass the input to command method
    output = game.command(command)
```

#### create a server

- `accept` provide you with a socket with inputs and outputs
- and `listen` to use the auto-grader
- use `socket.send` replace `input` and use `socket.send` to send that to the client
- Change output engine

```python
EscapeRoomGame(output=my_write_function)
# it has to take a string as input
# socket.send takes bytes as input
# read up on how Python 3 distinguishes between bytes and strings. Diff from Python 2.
```

- send and recv

`socket.send` cant distinguish two message, so use it twice

End every msg with `<EOL>\n`, since `recv` cant really see two msg, where EOL is a made up

```python
data = s.recv(1024) # this could be multiple messages
data_as_string = data.encode() # convert from bytes to string
lines = data_as_string.split("\n")
for line in lines:
    # process each line.
```

### client

- use `input` to get user input
- use `socket.send` to send the input
- use `socket.recv` to get the response

- note: data needs to be sent with `<EOL>\n` appended to each transmission.

### Syntax

![](../../../2019-10-25-01-04-39.png)

- capitalize first letter of a Class name
- Donâ€™t name the same variable as class, first letter of variable should be in lower case
- [format output](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-output-formatting/)
